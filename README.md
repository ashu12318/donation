# Crypto Donation

# Overview
This Dapp aims to provide a way for anyone (with some ether at their disposal) to raise fund for any cause.
Users can browse from a catalog of Causes and whichever they feal appealing, and can donate to that cause using their crypto wallet.

This Dapp leverages the security and trustlessness of the best in class Etherium platform and highly secure wallet Metamask.

# Build the Project
In order to build and run the project in your local you will need following minimum setup
1. Install Metamask extension to your fav browser [Download Link](https://metamask.io/download.html)
2. NodeJS(**v14.13.0**) and NPM(**6.14.8**) [Download Link](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v14.13.0/)

**Follow are the 2 ways to interact with this Dapp**  

### Connecting to Local Blockchain
In adition to the above two softwares you will need following additional setup  
1. Download the project repo(either as zip or clone it using git)
2. Install Ganache, a local blockchain network and configure a workspace with your mnemonic phrase same as used in Metamask account [Download Link](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache)
3. Deploying Smart Contract  
    1. Run Ganache: Ensure its running on port 7545
    2. Move to root directory of Project i.e. "Donation"
    3. Install node packages
        > npm install
    4. [*Optional*] Compile it once to ensure everything is fine
        > truffle compile
    5. [*Optional*] Run tests to ensure Smart Contract is behaving as planned
        > tuffle test
    6. Deploy Smart Contract to Ganache (Reset flag will deploy contracts fresh)
        > truffle migrate --reset
4. Running front-end
    1. Move to "Donation/client" directory
    2. run the local development server from console/terminal
        > npm install  
        > npm start  
    3. This should launch the Dapp at "localhost:3000"
    4. Ensure you are connected to local blockchain network i.e. network id 5777 running at localhost:7545  
        Dapp will show you on top left corner, the network you are currently connected to.
    5. Start Interacting with Dapp

### Connecting to testnet(Rinkeby)
Currently Smart Contracts has been deployed to Rinkeby testnet.  
You can find the Smart Contract Rinkeby Address in "Donation/deploued_addresses.txt"  
1. Download the project repo(either as zip or clone it using git)
2. Get some test-network ether from faucet, here is a link for [rinkeby](https://faucet.rinkeby.io/)
2. Move to root directory i.e. "Donation"
3. Create a new file ".env"
4. Declare 2 variables as below. Here is the link on how to get your [infura project key](https://blog.infura.io/getting-started-with-infura-28e41844cc89/?&utm_source=infurablog&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=tutorials&utm_content=getting_started_eth_api)  
    > INFURA_KEY=paste your infura key here (without quotes)  
    > MNEMONIC=paste your mnemonic here (without quotes)  
5. Run following command to deploy contract to network your desired network, here in this case its rinkeby  
    > truffle migrate --reset --network rinkeby  
6. Running front-end  
    1. Move to "Donation/client" directory  
    2. run the local development server from console/terminal  
        > npm install  
        > npm start  
    3. This should launch the Dapp at "localhost:3000"  
    4. Ensure you are connected to Rinkeby blockchain network i.e. network id 4  
        Dapp will show you on top left corner, the network you are currently connected to.  
    5. Start Interacting with Dapp  

Note: Dapp only supports two test networks i.e. rinkeby and ropsten.
